The Processing port of this p5 sketch: https://caseylabrack.com/sketches/lissajous-animated/

Using it to make animated .gifs of these lissajous figures. (P5 is not great for making animated gifs).

Lissajous figures based on the lesson from Generative Design: http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/1/M_2_5_01. Animation comes from incrementing the *phi* parameter.
